Campus Network Design – CCNA Project
📌 Project Overview

This project represents a university campus network designed and simulated using Cisco Packet Tracer.
The network includes a main campus and a branch campus, connected through multiple routers using dynamic routing.

🏫 Network Structure
Main Campus
Core Router connected to the main server
Multilayer switch
Three buildings:
Building A: Admin, HR, Finance, Business
Building B: A&C, A&D
Building C: Student Lab, IT Department
Branch Campus
One router connected to a multilayer switch
Two networks:
Staff Network
Student Network

🔧 Technologies Implemented
VLANs for department and faculty segmentation
Inter-VLAN Routing using multilayer switches
DHCP for dynamic IP address allocation
OSPF for routing between campus routers
Router security basics (password protection)(password: 11)
Router configuration backups were saved on the main server

🛠 Tools Used
Cisco Packet Tracer
Cisco IOS CLI
🎯 Learning Outcomes
Designing scalable campus networks
Implementing VLANs in multi-building environments
Configuring and troubleshooting OSPF
Understanding real-world network segmentation
Applying basic network security practices
